# Gaussian Splat Viewer

This is the WebGL implementation for viewing Splat models in browsers. The models can be chosen from a list or 
dropped right into the web page. More info on the implementation can be found in the [original repo](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat).

The viewer can be accessed [from here](https://vladimirka002.github.io/splat-webgl/).
